# TAKFreeServer
TAKFreeServer is a Python3 implemnentation of the TAK Server for devices like CivTAK , WinTak and ITak, it is cross-platform and is only dependent on python stdlib libraries. 

This code in in ALPHA STAGE
If you have any issues don't hesitate to bring it up as TAKFreeServer is still in the early stages of development.

## Architecture
TAKFreeServer uses a MVC pattern, the concept of a COT is described in a set of Domain classes, generated  from the UML model using a Mpodel Driven Architecture approach.

## Documentation
under docs, you can find various documents including an UMl model of the model classes involved in a COT event.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Installing and using FreeTakServer
FreeTakServer  requires Python 3.0 or later to run. Once you’ve installed Python 3, install TAKLib using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tapawingo/TAKlib.git

cd TAKLib
```

It is available in 2 flavours:
- Windows service
- Linux Demon

### Linux Demon

run the following command in terminal in the directory where TAKDaemon.py is installed
```
python3 TAKDaemon.py
```

### Windows Service
To run this program you require admin priviliges

1. allow python.exe in firewall
2. open whichever port you will be using for connections in firewall
3. kill any program already running on whichever port you've decided to use
4. open CMD with admin
5. cd into whichever directory FreetakServer is located
```
Cd FreeTakServer/TakWinService
```
6. type the following 
```
beginProgramAsService.py install
```
7. type

TAKFreeServer_running_as_service.py
```
can be run independently 

#### Troubleshooting
if you have this error Python windows service “Error starting service: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion”

attempt to add python to the system path
